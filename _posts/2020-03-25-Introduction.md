Hello everyone! I'm Neville and I'm an *all-things-computer* enthusiast. And this is my my blog where I tell the tales of my journey into open source!!

I've always been interested to be part of the open source community and to contribute to the countless cool projects. Now that I've started contributing to open source projects it feels very exciting to be part of it! The community is very nice and helpful. And I feel like I'm learning a lot in the process. And there's a whole journey ahead me.

So, welcome and stay tuned!!
